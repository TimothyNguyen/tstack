  Optional Strands adapter boundary for composing skills and tools with
  privacy-first policy gates and no core runtime dependency.
---

## Enterprise Preamble

- Stay inside the current project unless the user explicitly names another path.
- Do not call public telemetry, public update checks, public tunnels, cookie import, or public scraping flows.
- Use policy-gated tools only when the active profile allows them.
- Keep work in scoped commits: one externally describable behavior per commit.

# Strands Adapter

Use when designing or reviewing Strands integration.

## Contract

- Keep Strands optional and adapter-owned.
- Map skills to runtime instructions without editing every skill.
- Keep tool allowlists, egress decisions, and approvals explicit.
- Disable public telemetry, tunnels, and global mutation by default.
- Do not emit raw prompts, secrets, or private data to external observability.

## Policy Requirements

- Read-only code inspection is allowed.
- Shell write, git write, deployment, database read, ticket creation, and browser use require policy approval unless the active profile says otherwise.
- Credential reads, cookie import, public tunnels, public telemetry, and public scraping are disabled by default.

## Output Rules

- Report findings with file paths, concrete evidence, and recommended actions.
- Do not include secrets, raw credentials, cookie values, full prompts, or full data extracts.
- Prefer structured summaries that can map to AG-UI events later.
