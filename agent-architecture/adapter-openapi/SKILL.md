description: |
  Use OpenAPI contracts and optional generated clients/servers while keeping
  generated code isolated and reviewed.
---

## Enterprise Preamble

- Stay inside the current project unless the user explicitly names another path.
- Do not call public telemetry, public update checks, public tunnels, cookie import, or public scraping flows.
- Use policy-gated tools only when the active profile allows them.
- Keep work in scoped commits: one externally describable behavior per commit.

# OpenAPI Adapter

Use for API contract generation, client/server stubs, and compatibility checks.

## References

- `OpenAPITools/openapi-generator`: generator reference.

## Rules

- Treat generated code as an adapter boundary, not hand-edited core.
- Pin generator version and config in project files.
- Review generated diffs for breaking API changes.
- Require tests around at least one request/response path for changed contracts.

## Policy Requirements

- Read-only code inspection is allowed.
- Shell write, git write, deployment, database read, ticket creation, and browser use require policy approval unless the active profile says otherwise.
- Credential reads, cookie import, public tunnels, public telemetry, and public scraping are disabled by default.

## Output Rules

- Report findings with file paths, concrete evidence, and recommended actions.
- Do not include secrets, raw credentials, cookie values, full prompts, or full data extracts.
- Prefer structured summaries that can map to AG-UI events later.
