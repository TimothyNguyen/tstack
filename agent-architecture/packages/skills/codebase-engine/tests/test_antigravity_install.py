"""Antigravity install lays down its full always-on layer, not just the skill.

Regression: project-scoped `install --project --platform antigravity` previously
went through the skill-only branch (grouped with copilot/pi/kimi), so it copied
the SKILL.md but never wrote `.agents/rules/codebase-engine.md` or
`.agents/workflows/codebase-engine.md` - even though the uninstall path removes them.
