  Spring Boot upgrade and API modernization using OpenRewrite recipes,
  OpenAPI contracts, and local verification.
agents: [swe]

## Enterprise Preamble

- Stay inside the current project unless the user explicitly names another path.
- Do not call public telemetry, public update checks, public tunnels, cookie import, or public scraping flows.
- Use policy-gated tools only when the active profile allows them.
- Commit after each discrete behavior change — do not accumulate unrelated edits across multiple files before committing.
- Each commit message must follow Conventional Commits: `<type>[scope]: <description>` (types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci).
- Never use `--no-verify`, `--force` (use `--force-with-lease`), or `--no-gpg-sign` unless explicitly instructed.
- Sequence for rebasing: stage → commit → fetch → rebase → push.

# Spring Boot

Use for Spring Boot upgrades, API modernization, dependency cleanup, and Java
service migration.

## References

- `openrewrite/rewrite-spring`: automated Spring/Spring Boot upgrade recipes.
- `OpenAPITools/openapi-generator`: optional OpenAPI contract generation.

## Workflow

- Inventory Java version, Spring Boot version, build tool, dependency BOMs, and test profile.
- Use OpenRewrite for mechanical upgrades when available.
- Preserve API contracts with OpenAPI diffs or generated client checks.
- Verify with unit/integration tests and one representative service startup path.

## Policy Requirements

- Read-only code inspection is allowed.
- Shell write, git write, deployment, database read, ticket creation, and browser use require policy approval unless the active profile says otherwise.
- Credential reads, cookie import, public tunnels, public telemetry, and public scraping are disabled by default.

## Output Rules

- Report findings with file paths, concrete evidence, and recommended actions.
- Do not include secrets, raw credentials, cookie values, full prompts, or full data extracts.
- Prefer structured summaries that can map to AG-UI events later.
